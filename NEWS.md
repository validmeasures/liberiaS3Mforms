# liberiaS3Mforms v0.1.2

Third release of `liberiaS3Mforms`. In this release, the following changes were implemented:

* revamped the approach to selecting which child of a mother with more than one child to choose for the survey for other coverage indicators. The `indexed-repeat()` function is now used outside of the `child_repeat` loop to extract the information of the child selected via a call to `random()` function

* removed `field-list` appearance from the anthorpometric measurements (including remeasurement)
